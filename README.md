# gdd-template-generator
Web application that generates templates for game design documents (often abbreviated GDD).

## Summary
The purpose of this project was to learn how to use the Laravel framework. The gdd template can be generated through a form or an excel template.

Once the gdd template is generated, the users of the application will be able to visualize the templates of other users; if they find an interesting game idea, the interested party can contact the template creator to negotiate the game idea.


### Features
- **User control.** New users can register and log in to the app.
- **Display templates.** Users can view their created gdd templates and those of other users.
- **Editing contact data.** The user can edit his contact data.
- **Creating a gdd template.** A gdd template can be created through a form, in which all the information about the game idea will be added. It can also be created by importing a template in excel format (.xlsx).
- **GDD template export.** If you are interested in a particular gdd template you can download it in pdf format.

The Laravel 10 framework was used for the development of this project.
